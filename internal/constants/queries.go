// LockWalletsSQL takes the wallet row locks for one transfer.
//
// Two properties matter:
//
//  1. ORDER BY id: rows are locked in a globally consistent order, so two
//     transfers touching the same pair of wallets can never hold locks in
//     opposite orders and deadlock (see README, "Deadlock freedom").
//  2. FOR NO KEY UPDATE instead of FOR UPDATE: it serializes wallet
//     modifications just as well, but does not conflict with the FOR KEY
//     SHARE locks that foreign key checks take, so unrelated inserts
//     referencing a hot wallet cannot block behind (or ahead of) this lock.
