-- Wallet Transfer Service: initial schema.
--
-- Model: wallets hold a stored balance; every balance change is recorded as
-- exactly one double-entry pair (DEBIT + CREDIT) in ledger_entries, tied to a
-- transfer row. Idempotency is enforced by a primary key on
-- idempotency_records.idempotency_key, which makes duplicate API requests
-- impossible to commit twice (see README for the transaction design).
--
-- Amounts are integers in minor units (e.g. cents). No floats, ever.
